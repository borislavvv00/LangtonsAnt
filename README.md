Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine. For more information about it check the wiki.

It takes me a couple of hours to make it but it was interesting.

The rules are :
At a white square, ant turns 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
At a black square, ant turns 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
